- [x] Arrays

We read values out of arrays using their numerical position, counting from 0. This “counting from 0” has a technical term: we can say that Swift’s arrays are zero-based. Swift will automatically crash your program if you attempt to read an array using an invalid index.
I know what you’re thinking: an app crash is bad, right? Right. But trust me: if Swift didn’t crash then it’s very likely you would get back bad data, because you tried to read a value outside what your array holds.

- [x] Sets

Sets are collections of values just like arrays, except they have two differences:
1. Items aren’t stored in any order; they are stored in what is effectively a random order.
2. No item can appear twice in a set; all items must be unique.
If you try to insert a duplicate item into a set, the duplicates get ignored. For example:
```
let colors2 = Set(["red", "green", "blue", "red", "blue"])
```
This difference between set and array means that sets are more useful for times when you want to say “does this item exist?”
