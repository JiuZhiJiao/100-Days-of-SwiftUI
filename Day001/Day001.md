- [x] Varibles

Once you create a variable using var, you can change it as often as you want without using var again. For example:
```
var favoriteShow = "Orange is the New Black"
favoriteShow = "The Good Place"
favoriteShow = "Doctor Who"
```

- [x] Srtings and Integers

Swift is what’s known as a type-safe language, which means that every variable must be of one specific type. When you create a variable Swift can figure out what type the variable is based on what kind of data you assign to it, and from then on that variable will always have that one specific type.
If you have large numbers, Swift lets you use underscores as thousands separators – they don’t change the number, but they do make it easier to read. 
```
var population = 8_000_000
```

- [x] Multi-line Strings

If you want multi-line strings you need slightly different syntax: start and end with three double quote marks, and the final three quotes must be on a line by themselves, like this:
```
var str1 = """
This goes
over multiple
lines
"""
```
If you only want multi-line strings to format your code neatly, and you don’t want those line breaks to actually be in your string, end each line with a \, like this:
```
var str2 = """
This goes \
over multiple \
lines
"""
```
